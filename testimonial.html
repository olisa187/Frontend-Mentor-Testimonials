                        &ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been looking
                        to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                        completing
                        the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                        at a VR startup. &rdquo;

                        &ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                        to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                        wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                        no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                        example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! &rdquo;
